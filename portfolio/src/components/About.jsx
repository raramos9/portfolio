                    A lot of my passions lie at the intersection of machine learning
                    and software engineering. I've been able to explore this through hackathons,
                    personal projects, and most recently contract work!

                    Outside of school I train in Brazillian Jiu Jitsu, 
                    I go bouldering in hopes I get a back like Baki, and most recently im learning
                    how to sew. One project im trying to work on right now is making my own pair of jeans.
